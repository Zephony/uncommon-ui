# Introduction

In a land far far away, there was a place where components of all shapes and sizes lived free in harmony, and nobody judged them.

From your regular old `Buttons` to not so regular `Image Tiles`, this is a place where components can run wild.

Welcome to **Uncommon UI - The Component Utopia**

# What is Uncommon UI?

Uncommon UI aims to be a library of reusable React components that range for simple building blocks to more complex UI components that are probably only created when the need arises or by crazy people.
This can be a place of expression and wild ideas that can push the boundaries of UI/UX principles.

If you want to add to the functionality or create a new component please take a look at our CONTRIBUTION.md
