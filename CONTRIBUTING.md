# Contributing

If you have found an issue or would like to request a new feature, simply create a new issue detailing the request. We also welcome pull requests. See below for information on getting started with development and submitting pull requests.

## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Zephony/uncommon-ui/issues/new). Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

**Please see the Submission Guidelines below**.

## Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Zephony/uncommon-ui/issues/new). If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

- **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Zephony/uncommon-ui/issues/new) so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent
  duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the
  project.
- **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Zephony/uncommon-ui) as a Pull Request.

### Submitting a Pull Request

If you wish to submit a pull request for a new feature or issue, you should start by forking this repository first. After you have forked and cloned the repository locally, create a new branch with a name that loosely describes the issue on which you will be working. Once you think you have the addressed the issue in question, submit a pull request. Here are some guidelines to follow when writing code for uncommon-ui:

- Ensure your commit messages are [meaningful](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
- Intermediate and work-in-progress commits should be rebased out.
- Keep pull requests tightly scoped to the issue or feature being addressed.
- All changes from every developer must go through code review before they will be merged.
- All changes must have unit tests.
- All components must have a stories associated with it.
